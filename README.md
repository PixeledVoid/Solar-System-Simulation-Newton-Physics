Libraries/Modules used:
- `Pygame`
- `math`

Concepts required:
- Newton's gravitation (To calculate the force of attraction between bodies)
  NOTE: In cases like planets, newton's equation is not applicable (Einstein's theory is much more precise)
- Basic Vector (Components, addition)
- Laws of motion

Overall and easy project, made it to explore `Pygame` and because it looked cool!
